Documentation of Rumble Fighter/Gem Fighter Packets and Network Functions.

DISCLAIMER: This documentation is mostly for me and will NOT provide detailed support on achieving the same results. It will however contain some information which may not always be complete on what I am doing and how I am doing it, I am also planning to capture packets and organise them in such a way if the Rumble Fighter got shutdown, we have some documentation to possibly create a Private Server. If someone happens to stumble across this and thinks they can offer help, I encourage you to get in touch with me and discuss this. Discord: Primitheus#6431.


What is the goal of this?
To be honest, it's mostly for education. Reverse Engineering is a hobby of mine and Rumble Fighter was once a very huge interest, so, why not combine the two and mess with it. The end game would be to create a Packet Editor or even a Private Server for newer and older versions of the game purely for education and a bit of fun without any intention of monetization. 
Rumble Fighter uses XOR Encryption for the packets. The XOR key generation is yet to be fully understood, however I have reversed a good chunk of it. The method used is the same for both Rumble Fighter and Gem Fighter. (OLD RUMBLE/GEM FIGHTER SEEMS TO NOT EVEN USE ENCRYPTION?? - Best chance of a private server if we had packet captures from when the game was still up).

What does this mean?
It means I can see the packets the game sends in unencrypted format and also edit the packet as it is being encrypted before it is sent to the server and therefore yield interesting results. However this is not a perfect packet editor, it is a hacky way of editing and depending on how it is used could be very powerful or not so much.
I still wonder why I need your email to gift items... ;).
