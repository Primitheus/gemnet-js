<u>Rumble Fighter/Gem Fighter Server Emulator <strong>[PROOF-OF-CONCEPT]</strong>.</u></br>

<strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> This documentation is mostly for me and will NOT provide detailed support on achieving the same results.

What is the goal of this? </br>
To be honest, it's mostly for education. Reverse Engineering is a hobby of mine and Rumble Fighter was a childhood game. The end game would be to create a Packet Editor or even a Private Server for newer and older versions of the game purely for education. 

<strong>Proxy.js</strong> </br>
This is a proxy to observe the (unencrypted) packets in realtime.
TODO: Packet Replay, Packet Descriptions.

<strong>Server.js</strong> </br>
New Private Server build entirely in nodejs, this is very poorly made and lacks quality, but it proves a Private Server is possible. 
TODO: Rewrite this in C++/C#. Integrate my PS to 33343
